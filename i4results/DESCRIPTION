Description: The i4results package provides a convenient function, i4results(),
  to compare coefficients from one original model and multiple robustness (replication) 
  models side by side. The results can be returned in a long-format data frame or exported 
  directly to Excel, with optional appending. This workflow mirrors an equivalent Stata ado 
  process, excluding the intercept by default and supporting unlimited numbers of models.
